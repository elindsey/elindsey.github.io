title: "Data plane vs Control plane"
---

General things to keep in mind when building reliable data planes
Trust control plane... mostly. Trust but verify
Control planes tend to be buggier, less well operated, complex business logic
Don't build more than necessary
Minimize modality
Minimize configuration?
