## Deployment

This site is deployed automatically via a Github Workflow. Like normal Github
Pages it will regenerate the site on each push, but it additionally enables you
to use any bespoke Jekyll configuration. It does so in a way that maintains
quick publish times (<1min from commit to publish).

Refer to
[.github/workflows](https://github.com/elindsey/elindsey.github.io/tree/dev/.github/workflows)
for the entirely self-contained deployment workflow. This model is easily
extensible to other static site generators.
