If you're looking to support work that I've done, please consider donating to
one of these organizations instead. Any amount is welcome, and all accept
contributions as small as $5.

### [Page Ahead](http://pageahead.org) and [The Book Faeries](https://thebookfairies.org)

These two organizations focus on childhood literacy - Page Ahead in Seattle and
Book Faeries in the New York area. It's [important
work](http://www.pageahead.org/childrens-literacy_why-childrens-literacy.php)
and one of the areas I care most about.

### [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate/)

The Internet Archive is basically what it sounds like: an archive of all sites
online plus freely available content. Think of it as the Internet equivalent
of the Library of Congress. It's invaluable for getting information that is no
longer online, seeing what a website looked like a decade ago, finding live
music or old software, etc.

### [Insight Retreat Center](https://www.insightretreatcenter.org/donations/)

IRC is unique in that all Vipassana retreats are freely offered and it runs
entirely on donations and volunteers. I've directly benefitted from it, and
it's very important to me that it remain available. It's associated with the
Redwood City [IMC](https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/vision/).

### [Bellaire Public Library](https://www.fotbl.com)

Bellaire is the library that I went to as a kid. I have fond memories of
digging through the stacks for Harry Harrison novels and racking up stickers
from the summer reading program. It was probably the institution most
responsible for my education, moreso than the public school system.

### [New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/give)

NYPL gets a lot of my tax dollars, but they still manage to spend it all.
