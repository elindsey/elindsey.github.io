I'm a software developer and tech lead focused on networking and systems
programming. 

I've worked at a [few](https://www.netflix.com/)
[different](https://aws.amazon.com) [places](https://ns1.com),
[big](https://www.facebook.com) and [small](https://materialize.com). My resume
is available upon request.

I rarely blog these days, but I'm always open to chatting over email.
